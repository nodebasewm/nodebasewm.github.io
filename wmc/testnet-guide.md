# Base Sepolia Testnet

Add Base Sepolia Testnet Network to your metamask and switch to it.

You can use this link [Chainlink base sepolia](https://chainlist.org/chain/84532?%20testnets=false)

Or you can add it manually using following settings..

1. Network Name : Base Sepolia Testnet
2. New RPC URL: https://base-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com
3. Chain ID: 84532
4. Currency symbol: ETH
5. Block Explorer URL: https://sepolia.baseorg.org

# Eth Faucet for Base Sepolia

The next this is to get some testnet Eth to use for gas fees on Base sepolia.
You will need this later on to sign transactions to get WMTx from the WM faucet.

Most of the Eth faucets require you to hold a min amount of Eth on mainnet,

Here you can find different faucets: [faucet list Eth base sepolia](https://chainlist.org/chain/84532?%20testnets=false).

I have used successfully the Coinbase and quicknode faucets. But both required me to hold 
at least  0.001 ETH on Ethereum mainnet.
